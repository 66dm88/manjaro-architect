1. 	Amend kernel to use manjaro kernels (function install_base, lines 1504-1591) 
		- Script might produce bootable systems after this
		- Later add kernel choice menu
2. 	Replace driver installation with mhwd (function setup_graphics_card, lines 1886-2066)
		- Should simplify code signicantly
3. 	Amend package choice function (install_de_wm function, lines 2069-2145)
 	to install manjaro edition package lists and desktop-settings packages.
 		- Otherwise produced installations do not really resemble manjaro editions
4.	Make user creation and password setting part of the installer 
		- use code from manjaro cli-installer
5. 	Add support for btrfs submodules 
		- use code from manjaro cli-installer
6.	Generate a proper fstab, even though system seems to boot fine without one.
